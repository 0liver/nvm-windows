# NVM for Windows v1.1.8 Notes

Truth be told, I did not want to release this version now. I am actively working on the successor project [rt](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/discussions/565), and I hoped NVM for Windows 1.1.8 would be the last version before releasing rt. However, there have been notable changes in the Node ecosystem.

**corepack**

In September 2021, Node.js v16.9.0 introduced [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). This experimental new feature essentially allows developers to use transparently use npm, pnpm, or yarn. To support this feature, NVM4W must download and process a different distribution file than it has used previously.

_NVM for Windows 1.1.8 is being released to support corepack._

## Updates

Several long-requested features/fixes have been merged since v1.1.7. I did not get to test all of them as extensively as I wanted to. That said, I believe they are stable. These features include:

1. corepack support (see above)
2. Support for spaces in filepaths [#355](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/355).
3. `nvm install latest` installs the latest patch version of Node (instead of latest minor).
4. `nvm install lts` installs the latest LTS patch version (new).
5. `nvm use latest`, `nvm use lts`, and `nvm use newest` (new) now supported.
6. Elevated permissions applied only when necessary [#511](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/511).
7. `nvm current` (new) displays the active version.

Several additional minor updates have been applied as well.

## What didn't make it in?

1. Aliases - these were originally scheduled for 1.1.8, but I never got to work on them.

## WARNING

Version 1.1.8 is **not code signed**. Code-signed applications are trusted by Windows and will install easily. Users are prompted with a screen like this one:

![code signed](https://www.globalsign.com/application/files/9415/8088/1150/ms-authenticode-warning2.png)

Non-code-signed applications can _usually_ be installed, but they will throw a warning like this:

**Why?**

I paid for the last code signing certificates out of pocket, but they've expired. Sponsorships, to date, haven't even come close to covering the cost of a new code signing certificate (let alone the last one). I plan to purchase a new code signing certificate for my commercial software endeavors. At that time, I will release a code-signed version of NVM4W. That will most likely be after the holidays (early next year).

**Who will this affect?**

This won't affect most users, but enterprise users and those distributing NVM4W in corporate environments may run into problems.

**If your organization is impacted by this and cannot wait, I will accept sponsorship money to expedite the delivery of a code-signed version.** The required certificate is about $1000.
