# NVM for Windows v1.1.8 Notes

Truth be told, I did not want to release this version right now. I am working on the successor project [rt](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/discussions/565), which was supposed to be the last version before the rt release. However, notable changes in the Node ecosystem warrant a new version now.

**Node Corepack**

In September 2021, Node.js v16.9.0 introduced [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). This experimental new feature allows transparent use of npm, pnpm, or yarn. To support this feature, NVM4W must download and process a different distribution file than it has used previously.

As a result, NVM for Windows 1.1.8 is being released to support corepack.

## How to Upgrade

All files can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/tag/1.1.8).

**If you do not have NVM for Windows installed**
Use the instructions in the README.

**If you already have an older version of NVM for Windows installed**
Download *nvm-update.zip* and extract it. You will find a file called *nvm-update.exe*. Double click to run it. This will prompt for the version you wish to upgrade to (pre-populated w/ 1.1.8).

nvm-update.exe can also be run from the command line using the `/S` flag to suppress the prompt. To do this, run `nvm-update.exe 1.1.8 /S`.

## What's New

Several long-requested features/fixes have been merged since v1.1.7. I did not get to test all of them as extensively as I wanted to, but I believe they are stable. These features include:

1. corepack support (see above)
2. Support for spaces in filepaths [#355](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/355).
3. `nvm install latest` - installs the latest patch version of Node (instead of latest minor).
4. `nvm install lts` - installs the latest LTS patch version (new).
5. `nvm use latest`, `nvm use lts`, and `nvm use newest` (new) now supported.
6. Elevated permissions applied only when necessary [#511](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/pull/511).
7. `nvm current` (new) displays the active version.

Numerous edge case fixes have been applied as well.

## What didn't make it in?

1. Aliases - these were originally scheduled for 1.1.8, but I never got to work on them.

## WARNING

Version 1.1.8 is **not code signed**. Code-signed applications are trusted by Windows and will install easily. Users are prompted with a screen like this one:

![code signed](https://www.globalsign.com/application/files/9415/8088/1150/ms-authenticode-warning2.png)

Non-code-signed applications can _usually_ be installed, but they will throw a warning like this:

**Why?**

I paid for the last code signing certificates out of pocket, but they've expired. Sponsorships, to date, haven't even come close to covering the cost of a new code signing certificate (let alone the last one).

**Who will this affect?**

This won't affect most users, but enterprise users and those distributing NVM4W in corporate environments may run into problems.

**If your organization is impacted by this, I will accept sponsorship money to expedite the delivery of a code-signed version.** The required EV certificate is about $1000. Please direct message me on Twitter [@goldglovecb](https://twitter.com/goldglovecb) if you'd like to help cover this cost.
